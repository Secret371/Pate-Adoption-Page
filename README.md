# Pet Adoption Page

This is a simple, single-page front-end project created using HTML and CSS. It serves as a static landing page for a conceptual pet adoption website, featuring profile cards for a cat ("Tom") and a dog ("Jerry").

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate foundational HTML structure and CSS styling, with a focus on creating a responsive layout. The page uses CSS Flexbox to arrange content and media queries to ensure the layout adapts correctly to different screen sizes, particularly mobile devices.

## Features

* **Semantic HTML5:** Clean and well-structured HTML markup.
* **CSS Styling:** Custom styles for cards, typography, and layout.
* **Flexbox Layout:** The main `#pets` container uses `display: flex` to align the adoption cards.
* **Responsive Design:** A media query is used to stack the cards vertically on screens smaller than 768px (e.g., mobile phones), ensuring readability and a good user experience.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (Flexbox, Media Queries)

## Project Files

* `index.html`: Contains the structural markup for the webpage.
* `style.css`: Contains all styling rules, including layout, colors, and the responsive media query.
* `dog.jpg`: Image file for the "Jerry" (dog) card.
